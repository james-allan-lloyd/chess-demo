Chess Demo
----------

This is the result of a short technical interview project that I wrote back in 2016. It was for a UI developer position using C++ and Qt, so I decided to take the opportunity to learn the QML way of doing things while I was there. Written over the course of 2 days or so, I think, the point was to develop a basic chess MVP with the following:

- Ability for pieces to have distinct, valid moves, and have the game give feedback about these.
- The ability to record the game and replay it.

Updating it here just so I can prove that I can program still :)

Running
-------
To run the test or the app, make sure you add the import directory (relative to this file) to the QML2_IMPORT_PATH.

Testing
-------
I forget. It's probably something like `make test`.
